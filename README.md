## What is Zoom?

Zoom lets you zoom a split - making it full window. And zoom out to go back to your initial layout.

It's ideal to read all the messages in your quickfix window in full screen. Focus on that part of a window you want to concentrate on. Get rid of the noise.

## Installation
Use your favorite plugin manager and in install it like you normally would do.

Eg:
```
       Plug 'Mathijs-Bakker/zoom-vim'
```

## Configuration
Create your own key binding like:
```
       nmap <leader>z <Plug>Zoom
```
Put it somewhere in your vim.rc and your good to go.
